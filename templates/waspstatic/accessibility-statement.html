  <p>The Open University's web presence consists of several million individual pages across numerous websites. We want as many people as possible to be able to use our websites, and accessibility is an essential part of our mission. To adapt the content to your needs or preferences you should be able to:</p>

        <li>tab through the content; the current location will be indicated by a clear visual change.</li>
        <li>control the embedded media player to play audio and video materials.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Use a screen reader (e.g. JAWs, NVDA) to :
      <ul class="wp-block-list">
        <li>listen to the content of web pages and use any functionality on the page.</li>
        <li>list the headings and subheadings in the page and then jump to their location on the page.</li>
        <li>bring up a list of meaningful links on the page.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Use transcripts or closed captions with most audio and video materials.</li>
    <li>Download learning materials in alternative formats (e.g. Word document, PDF, ePub, Kindle eBook).</li>
    <li>If you have a print disability we provide&nbsp;<a href="https://msds.open.ac.uk/signon/SAMSDefault/SAMS001_Default.aspx?URL=http://www.open.ac.uk/libraryservices/subsites/sensusaccess/convert-a-file-with-sensus-access">SensusAccess</a>&nbsp;to students, which is an automated service that converts files from one format to another, for example, PDF to text, audio, Word or Braille.</li>

  <h2 id="non-compliance-with-the-accessibility-regulations">Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations</h2>
  <p>Current web technology is not capable of ensuring the accessibility of specialised notations (e.g., mathematics, chemistry, physics, music, phonetics etc.). We are monitoring developments in these areas and will improve our services as the technology matures.</p>
  <p>Some online activities cannot be made fully accessible (e.g., categorising an image). Wherever practical, an alternative activity will be provided.</p>
  <p>The level of accessibility during live events is limited. We are working closely with third-party suppliers and improving our internal systems to improve accessibility during live events.</p>
  <p>The Open University provides links to external websites that may not meet accessibility standards.</p>
